# LearningOpenGL
Repository for learning openGL

This is a solution that I have created whilst learning C++ & OpenGL, mainly to deepen my understanding of key concepts and to be used as a reference for how to achieve common OpenGL tasks. 

Projects
  1) HelloGLFW - initialization and basic usage of the GLFW library 
  2) HelloGLEW - basic usage of the GLEW library in conjunction with GLFW
  3) HelloTriangle - Drawing a triangle to the screen
  4) HelloShaders - the hello triangle project extended to use our shader rather then the default one
  5) TriangleClasses - Abstracting the api into our own classes

Requirements:
  Visual Studio 2017
  Desktop development with c++ Visual Studio module
  OpenGL 3.3 compatible graphics card

To Run:
  download / clone repo
  open LearningOpenGL.sln with visual studio 2017
  Build Solution
  right click the project you are working on and set as StartUpProject
  Run
  
All project's output executables to the bin directory of the solution
GLEW & GLFW object files can be found in the solution's dependencies directory
